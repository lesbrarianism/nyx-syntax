# nyx-syntax theme

This is a dark/sienna style Atom syntax theme based on Monokai and Atom Material.  All language files (originally from Atom Material) have been left in the styles folder for further customization.  I tinkered for awhile on this to suit my own preferences; feel free to do the same.  I'll also likely be updating every once in awile as I continue using it.

P.S. If you're not a fan of the customized bracket highlighting, you can remove it from the bottom of the base.less file, under `// Bracket Matcher`.
