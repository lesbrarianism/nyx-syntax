# nyx-syntax theme

This is a dark/sienna style Atom syntax theme based on Monokai and Atom Material.  I primarily write in HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, and Bash, but I left all language files (originally from Atom Material) in the styles folder.  I tinkered for awhile on this to suit my own preferences; feel free to do the same.

If you have suggestions, or created your own variation from this, link me!  I'd love to see it.

Looks pretty good when combined with the One Dark UI theme and SETI icons package.
