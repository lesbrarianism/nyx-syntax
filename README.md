# nyx-syntax theme

This is a dark/sienna style Atom syntax theme based on Monokai and Atom Material.  I primarily write in HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, and Bash, but I left all language files (originally from Atom Material) in the styles folder.  I tinkered for awhile on this to suit my own preferences; feel free to do the same.
