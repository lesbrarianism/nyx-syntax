# nyx-syntax theme

This is a dark/sienna style Atom syntax theme based on Monokai and Atom Material. I primarily write in HTML, CSS, PHP, and Bash, but I left all the languages in the styles folder (originally from Atom Material). I tinkered for awhile on this to suit my own preferences; feel free to do the same with it.
