# nyx-syntax theme

This is a dark/sienna style Atom syntax theme based on Monokai and Atom Material.  I primarily write in HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, and Bash, but I left all language files (originally from Atom Material) in the styles folder.  I tinkered for awhile on this to suit my own preferences; feel free to do the same.  I'll also likely be updating every once in awile as I continue using it.

P.S. If you're not a fan of the customized bracket highlighting, you can remove it from the bottom of the base.less file, under // Bracket Matcher.
